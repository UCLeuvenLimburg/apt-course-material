= Functional Programming

[IMPORTANT]
====
First of all, let me stress that I won't pretend functional programming is the ultimate panacea, the One True Way, the way _real_ programmers do it.
Like everything in life, it has both advantages and disadvantages.
Good programming consists of being able to apply the right concept in the right places, so as to both maximize the benefits and minimize the downsides of each approach.
