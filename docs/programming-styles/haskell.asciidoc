* Language is about what it does not allow
* Assembly = Anarchy
* We want a language that only allows us to write correct programs
* Two kinds of bugs
** Inherent bugs (null pointer dereference, memory leak, division by zero, ...)
** Code that does not perform the intended functionality
* What Haskell has not
** `null`
*** Hoare's Billion Dollar Mistake
*** Seldom do you want `null`
*** `Maybe`

*** Explicit in type
** Strictness
** Decent debugger...
*** Working in interactive shell
